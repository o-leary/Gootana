Gootana
=================
Chrome extension redirecting Bing search to Google

##How it works
Gootana is a background extension for Google Chrome built for Windows 10. It causes Chrome to open on startup, minimized as a taskbar tray icon, and redirects any Bing searches to Google. There are other addons which perform this task but all required Chrome to already be open to function, and if it was not, they would open a new window and continue straight to Bing.

##Privacy
Gootana reads only URLs addressed to "www.bing.com/search" and redirects accordingly, it does not record or store your search history.

##How to install
The extension is available to install from the [Chrome Web Store](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/gootana/njaohbmfgmnhhepebleleojpglehjehc). If you'd rather package it up yourself, simply add your own icon files icon16.png, icon48.png, and icon128.png, at their respective sizes, and zip up the whole folder. You can install it in Chrome by enabling developer mode and dragging the zip file into the extensions tab.
